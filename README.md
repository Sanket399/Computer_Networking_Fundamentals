# Computer Networking Fundamentals 🚀

Welcome to my **Computer Networking Fundamentals** repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my learning journey through the fundamentals of networking, ranging from basic concepts to more advanced topics and practical configurations.

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository will be a living document of my exploration into the world of networking. I’ll be sharing my notes, configurations, and exercises as I learn different networking protocols, tools, and technologies. Expect this repo to grow as I dive deeper into various areas of computer networking.

## 📝 Topics I Plan to Cover

Here are some of the key topics that I’ll explore in this repository:

- **Basic Networking Concepts**

  - OSI Model
  - TCP/IP Model
  - IP Addressing (IPv4, IPv6)
  - Subnetting and CIDR

- **Routing Protocols**

  - Static Routing
  - Dynamic Routing (RIP, EIGRP, OSPF)

- **Switching**

  - VLANs
  - Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

- **Network Security Fundamentals**

  - Firewalls
  - IDS/IPS
  - Packet Filtering

- **Network Automation**

  - Automating tasks with **Ansible**

- **Cisco Packet Tracer Labs**
  - Simulations of real-world networking setups

## 🚀 Getting Started

There’s no specific structure right now, but I’ll be posting files and folders as I progress. Whether it's notes, configurations, or Packet Tracer files, everything I learn and practice will be uploaded here.

## 🛠 Tools I Use

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** for network simulations
- **Ansible** for network automation
- **Wireshark** for packet analysis
